# Union Function in JavaScript (ES6)

This project provides a **union function** in JavaScript that merges two arrays while:
- **Preserving order** of elements.
- **Removing duplicate elements** (including primitives, objects, and deeply nested structures).
- **Using `Set` for primitive deduplication** and a **custom deep comparison function** for objects.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Handles **primitive values, objects, arrays, and deeply nested structures**.
- ✅ Uses **Set for fast lookup** of primitive values.
- ✅ Performs **deep equality checks** for objects and arrays.
- ✅ Preserves the **original order** of appearance.
- ✅ Includes **Jest unit tests** for reliability.
